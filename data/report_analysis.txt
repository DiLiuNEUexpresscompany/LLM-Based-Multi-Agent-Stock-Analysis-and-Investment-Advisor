Query: Analyze nvidia's financial performance over the past year.

Summary:
NVIDIA's financial performance over the past year has been exceptionally strong, as evidenced by their third-quarter fiscal 2025 results. The company reported a record quarterly revenue of $35.1 billion, marking a significant increase of 17% from the previous quarter and an impressive 94% rise from the same period last year. This growth is largely driven by the Data Center segment, which alone generated $30.8 billion in revenue, reflecting a 17% increase from the previous quarter and a remarkable 112% year-over-year growth.

For the nine months ended October 27, 2024, NVIDIA's total revenue reached $91.166 billion, more than doubling from $38.819 billion in the same period of 2023. The cost of revenue also increased, but at a slower pace, resulting in a gross profit of $69.135 billion, up from $27.510 billion the previous year. This indicates a strong improvement in gross margins, highlighting NVIDIA's operational efficiency and pricing power.

Operating expenses, particularly in research and development, rose significantly, reflecting NVIDIA's continued investment in innovation and technology leadership. R&D expenses for the nine-month period were $9.2 billion, up from $6.21 billion in the previous year.

Net income for the third quarter was $20.010 billion, a substantial increase from $16.952 billion a year ago, with diluted earnings per share rising to $0.81 from $0.68. These figures have been adjusted to reflect a ten-for-one stock split effective June 7, 2024.

Looking forward, NVIDIA's outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 suggests continued strong performance, although specific guidance figures were not provided in the excerpts. The company's robust growth trajectory, particularly in the Data Center segment, indicates a strong market position in AI and cloud computing, which are key drivers of future demand.

Overall, NVIDIA's financial results reflect a company capitalizing on significant market trends such as AI, data processing, and cloud infrastructure, positioning it well for sustained growth. The substantial increase in R&D spending underscores its commitment to maintaining technological leadership, which is crucial in the rapidly evolving tech landscape.
